*This page lists the status, timeline and policy for currently supported
releases of EDB Postgres for Kubernetes*.

EDB Postgres for Kubernetes is based on the open source
[CloudNativePG operator](https://cloudnative-pg.io), and follows the same
release cadence.

## Long Term Support (LTS)

On some selected minor versions, EDB extends the maintenance and support
offering on EDB Postgres for Kubernetes, allowing you to remain on the same
minor version for a fixed period of 12 months beyond the end-of-life (EOL) date
of the corresponding minor release of CloudNativePG.

In this timeframe, EDB will provide bug and security fixes by releasing new
patch or security patch versions of the operator.
